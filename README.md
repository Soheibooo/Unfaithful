# Unfaithful

Unfaithful is a game created during a Game Jam near Montreal
in less than 48h *(patched later)* inspired by an old game 
named "Office Lover Kiss". But this time, it's around hacking 
systems to get through levels within a ridiculous storyline.

Special thanks to Veselin and Aleksandrina for their
humorous appearance in this project!

The git history has been cleaned up for this release.
The Game Jam took place on 16th January, 2018.
