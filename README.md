# Unfaithful

Unfaithful is a game created during a Game Jam near Montreal
in less than 48h *(patched later)* inspired by an old game 
named "Office Lover Kiss". But this time, it's around hacking 
systems to get through levels within a ridiculous storyline.

Special thanks to Veselin and Aleksandrina for their
humorous appearance in this project!

The Game Jam took place on 16th January, 2018.
